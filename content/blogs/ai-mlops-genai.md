# ðŸ¤– AI/MLOps & GenAI Engineering Series

Welcome to my comprehensive series on MLOps, GenAI platforms, and production machine learning. Drawing from my experience as Principal Engineer at SambaNova Systems, I'll share practical insights from building scalable AI systems that serve real-world applications.

## Series Overview

This series covers the complete lifecycle of AI/ML systems - from initial model development to production deployment and monitoring. Whether you're building your first ML pipeline or scaling AI platforms for enterprise use, you'll find actionable insights here.

## Upcoming Topics

### 1. **Building Scalable MLOps Platforms: Architecture and Design Patterns**
*Coming Soon*

Foundation principles for ML platform engineering:
- Microservices architecture for ML systems
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes for ML workloads
- CI/CD pipelines for machine learning
- Model versioning and experiment tracking
- Infrastructure as Code for ML environments

### 2. **GenAI Application Development: From Prototype to Production**
*Coming Soon*

Practical guide to building GenAI applications:
- LLM integration patterns and best practices
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system design
- Prompt engineering and optimization techniques
- Managing context windows and token limits
- Cost optimization strategies for LLM APIs

### 3. **Custom Model Deployment: BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) Systems**
*Coming Soon*

Based on my experience reducing integration time by 90%:
- Model packaging and containerization
- Dynamic model loading and serving
- Multi-tenant model hosting
- Resource allocation and scaling strategies
- Model performance monitoring and alerting

### 4. **High-Performance AI Inference: Scaling to 1000+ Tokens/Sec**
*Coming Soon*

Technical deep dive into inference optimization:
- Streaming inference architectures
- Batching strategies and optimization
- GPU resource management and scheduling
- Load balancing for AI workloads
- Monitoring and observability for inference systems

### 5. **Kubernetes for ML: CRDs, Operators, and Advanced Patterns**
*Coming Soon*

Leveraging Kubernetes for ML workloads:
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for ML workflows
- Building Kubernetes Operators with KubeBuilder
- Managing long-running training jobs at scale
- Resource quotas and multi-tenancy
- Helm charts for ML applications

### 6. **LLM Fine-tuning and Model Optimization**
*Coming Soon*

Advanced techniques for model customization:
- Fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific tasks
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, AdaLoRA)
- Model quantization and optimization
- Distributed training patterns
- Evaluation frameworks for custom models

### 7. **AI Platform UI/UX: Building Developer-Friendly Interfaces**
*Coming Soon*

Creating interfaces that boost developer productivity:
- React + TypeScript patterns for ML applications
- Real-time data visualization for ML metrics
- State management with Redux RTK for complex AI workflows
- User experience design for technical users
- API design for ML platforms

### 8. **Production ML Monitoring and Observability**
*Coming Soon*

Ensuring reliability in production ML systems:
- Model drift detection and alerting
- Performance monitoring for ML applications
- Logging strategies for ML pipelines
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- SLA management for AI services
